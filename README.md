### The making of

#### Contracts can avoid a lot of problems

We decided to define 4 contracts for this project:

- [CSS contract](#css-contract)
- [Trello contract](#trello-contract)
- [GitHub contract](#github-contract)
- [Pull request contract](#pull-request-contract)

#### CSS Contract

**Colours**:

Light: #FFF9F0
Orange: #F6752D
Purple:#8584E8

- Instead of pixels let’s use **rem**, in our project:
  **1 rem = 10px**, so it’s easy to count in rem if you used to work with px
- For margins try to use **utility classes** (they start with “.u-”)
- To center containers on the page try to use **“.u-center-container”** utility class
- To center text you can use **“.u-center-text”** utility class
- To center elements inside container use **flexbox** or **grid** properties
- You can add new utility classes below “Utility classes” comment in index.css
- You can change values of utility classes and headers if you don’t like the current values (right now they are set just as an example), but be consistent.
- The main idea to use some utility classes is to make changes in one place, instead of changing it everywhere you need to use the same property.
- If you notice that you use one property with the same value in many places, make a utility class.

##### Trello Contract

- **Product Backlog** column: here you’ll find all the tasks we need to do during the Project
- **Sprint n** column: we have a column for each Sprint with its tasks
- Adding tasks:
  Create small tasks with a label that refers to an Epic
- Picking tickets(tasks) to do:
  1.  Assign the ticket to yourself
  2.  Put the ticket in the **Doing** column
  3.  Create a branch with the task name
  4.  Once the task is finished, put the ticket in the **Done** column
  5.  Choose another ticket and repeat points 1, 2, 3 and 4.

#### GitHub Contract

- Fork the repo and clone it in your device
- Everytime you do a task, create a new branch, with the task name, push it and do a Pull Request
